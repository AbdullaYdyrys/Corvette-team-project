# Corvette-team-project
The main goal in creating this project is to improve programming skills and gain a lot of experience for yourself. As we know, the process of choosing the next book to read takes a very long time, in this regard, the question arises: "How to make it as comfortable as possible?". This is our goal - to give the opportunity to choose different versions of books for those people who want to buy a book. 

The main advantage of this dataset is that you can find the right product that suits your needs. With this dataset, you can find the suitable book and get all the relevant information. Information such as the title of the book, the author you were looking for, or in what language you want to read the book, etc. To achieve this goal, we had to select a site and analyze its code. Since most sites provide protection against parsing, we decided to approach the choice with caution. 

At the meeting, after analyzing other sites with the team, we decided to choose a website https://www.goodreads.com/. Because this website meets our needs for several reasons. On this website you can search its database of books, annotations, quotes, and reviews. You can also create your own groups of book suggestions, surveys, polls, blogs, and discussions. You can see what books your friends are reading and track the books you're reading, have read, and want to read. This site also has a recommendation engine that analyzes 20 billion data points to give suggestions tailored to your literary tastes. This is a real marketplace and an electronic reference book for book lovers and one of the largest websites with a huge amount of data that is updated daily.  

While developing this project, we need to get the results of these questions: 
• Informations about books 
• How many books does a particular writer have? 
• Which are the books with the most occurrences in the list? 
• Which are the top 10 highly rated authors? 
• What is the rating distribution for the books?

In the end we can easily answer these questions by using our research. Because all the necessary information parsed and analyzed in our dataset.

We also built a simple recommendation system that recommends books with similar ratings.
